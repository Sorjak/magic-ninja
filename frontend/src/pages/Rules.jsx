        <p>Mage is a physical deck building game, a magical evolution from the popular improv warmup game Ninja.</p>
        <p>The rules and cards that make up the game are meant to tell the tale of a wizard fight in a dramatic and spectator friendly manner. 
            To that end, the spells represented in the cards should be powerful, weighty, and flashy.</p>
        <p>This website is meant to facilitate the creation and viewing of Mage cards. Please feel free to create any cards you want, and to modify ones you feel
            need adjustment.</p>
